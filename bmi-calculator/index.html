    <p>
      Better understand your weight in relation to your height using our body mass index (BM) calculator. While BMI is
      not the sole determinant of a healthy weight, it offers a valuable starting point to evaluate your overall health
      and well-being.

        What your BMI result means
      </h2>
      <p>
        A BMI range of 18.5 to 24.9 is considered a 'healthy weight.' Maintaining a healthy weight may lower your
        chances of experiencing health issues later on, such as obesity and type 2 diabetes. Aim for a nutritious diet
        with reduced fat and sugar content, incorporating ample fruits and vegetables. Additionally, strive for regular
        physical activity, ideally about 30 minutes daily for five days a week.

        What your BMI result means
      </h2>
      <p>
        A BMI range of 18.5 to 24.9 is considered a 'healthy weight.' Maintaining a healthy weight may lower your
        chances of experiencing health issues later on, such as obesity and type 2 diabetes. Aim for a nutritious diet
        with reduced fat and sugar content, incorporating ample fruits and vegetables. Additionally, strive for regular
        physical activity, ideally about 30 minutes daily for five days a week.

        Limitations of BMI
      </h2>
      <p>
        Although BMI is often a practical indicator of healthy weight, it is not suited for every person. Specific
        groups should carefully consider their BMI outcomes, and in certain cases, the measurement may not be beneficial
        to use.
      </p>

            Gender
          </h3>
        </div>
        <p>
          The development and body fat composition of girls and boys vary with age. Consequently, a child's age and
          gender are considered when evaluating their BMI.

          </h3>
        </div>
        <p>
          In aging individuals, increased body fat and muscle loss may cause BMI to underestimate body fat content.

        </div>
        <p>
          BMI may misclassify muscular individuals as overweight or obese, as it doesn't differentiate muscle from
          fat.

          Expectant mothers experience weight gain due to their growing baby. Maintaining a healthy pre-pregnancy BMI
          is advisable to minimise health risks for both mother and child.

          Certain health concerns may affect individuals of some Black and Asian origins at lower BMIs than others. To
